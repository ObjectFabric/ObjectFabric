title: The Founder Institute Experience
---

I just graduated from the Founder Institute. This startup accelerator program lasts four months, and is very intense. It was a great experience and helped get the basics right for ObjectFabric, and understand the path to a successful launch and fundraising effort. We will keep working together with the institute and my graduate peers and now friends. 

I want to thank Adeo Ressi and his team for their amazing work. The institute is now present on all continents and to me, helping entrepreneurs solve problems and improve global well-being is a most noble cause.
