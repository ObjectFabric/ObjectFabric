Check our samples in /objectfabric.examples to get started. They are packaged as a set of Eclipse projects, with step-by-step comments, and tools to easily deploy and debug a server on Amazon EC2. To keep the tradition alive, the first example is of course a Hello Word! Other samples demonstrate how ObjectFabric makes data persistence, synchronization, pub/sub, security using SSL, and other advanced scenarios really simple and high performance.

We added an Android version of our Images demo, where you can drag images using touch and see real-time synchronization with a desktop or Web application. This first SDK is Java and Android only.
