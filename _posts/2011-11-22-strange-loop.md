title: StrangeLoop talk on InfoQ
---

Giddy proud to see my StrangeLoop [talk](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Distributed-STM) on InfoQ! I never realized my accent was so thick though. [StrangeLoop](https://thestrangeloop.com) is an amazing and very technical conference about new programming models and languages. I described the concepts behind this project and where we are trying to go.
