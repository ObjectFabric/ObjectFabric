I had very interesting discussions last week at the [Game Developer Conference](http://www.gdconf.com) in San Francisco.  Online game platforms seem to be either multi-player, but running on a single server, or scalable and highly available, but not allowing real-time interaction between players.

Examples of real-time platforms include [Electrotank](http://www.electrotank.com), [RakNet](http://www.jenkinssoftware.com), or the proprietary platforms used e.g. by Blizzard or first person shooters. Players have to choose a server in advance and games only scale to a few thousand players at a time. Zynga or Kabam on the other hand can scale their infrastructure to millions of players, but each player can only interact in real-time with his own farm/empire/mafia etc.

There are a couple exceptions like Second Life or Eve Online, which seem to have been extremely challenging to develop and scale. I think ObjectFabric can bring something in terms of ease of use and scalability in this domain, but there is still a long way to go before making it look like a real gaming platform.

We met a company interested in turning their casual web game into a multi-player one, and our .NET SDK is perfect for integration in the Unity3D engine as it embeds Mono. Stay tuned!
