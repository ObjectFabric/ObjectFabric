ObjectFabric is a lightweight Java server that can establish bidirectional connections with Web, mobile, and desktop applications. Check http://objectfabric.com for more information.

Most of the code is packaged as a set of Eclipse projects. The best way to get started is to run the Java samples (objectfabric.examples) which are self documented through comments on every step.
