ObjectFabric dramatically simplifies the development of connected applications, either Web, mobile or desktop. Check http://objectfabric.com for more information. Most of the code is packaged as a set of Eclipse projects.

To get started, start by looking at samples in objectfabric.examples. Each sample shows a basic use case, and is self documented though comments.
