JS samples connect to the Java ExamplesServer:

objectfabric.examples/java/src/main/java/launchfirst/ExamplesServer.java

It can be launched using Maven from folder objectfabric.examples/java:

mvn exec:java

JS samples require objectfabric-js, which is produced using GWT &
gwt-exporter. The GWT compiler produces specialized JS for each
browser, and a loader named 'objectfabric.nocache.js'. You first need
to build OF using Maven (running 'mvn package' in the root folder).
objectfabric-js should then be located at:

objectfabric/js/target/objectfabric-js-{version}

The pom file for this project is already configured to serve both
html files and objectfabric-js so from the project folder (js), call:

mvn jetty:run

and try:

http://localhost:8080/01helloworld.html

It is possible to debug the underlying GWT code by calling

mvn gwt:run-codeserver

in the objectfabric-js folder (objectfabric/js) and follow the Super
